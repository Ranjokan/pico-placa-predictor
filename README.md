# pico-placa-predictor
This code allows the user to predict if the car with a specific plate can drive in the city on the day and hour selected.

This code was developed using Node.Js (`lite-server`), HTML, CSS and JS. The code also uses Bootstrap 4, and JQuery libraries to run and display information. 

The package `js-datepicker` was also installed to deploy the calendar and select the date. You can access its documentation with this link.
